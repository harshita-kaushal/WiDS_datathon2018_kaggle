Predictive Analytics for social good 

The WiDS Datathon is a new feature of the WiDS conference for 2018.  
The Datathon is working with the InterMedia Survey Institute, a grant recipient of the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation in their Financial Services for the Poor program.  



The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional financial and mobile financial services. 

The dataset is a product of InterMedia’s research to help the world’s poorest people take advantage of widely available mobile phones and other digital technology to access financial tools and participate more fully in their local economies. Women in these communities, in particular, are often largely excluded from the formal financial system. By predicting gender, the datathon teams will explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings will influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that will help to lift them and their families out of poverty. 

The WiDS Datathon competition seeks to encourage women data scientists to engage in social impact solutions by participating in a predictive analytics contest. The dataset for the challenge will contain demographic and behavioral information from a representative sample of survey respondents from India about their usage of traditional financial and mobile financial services. Participants will analyze the data and build machine learning and statistical models to predict the gender of each survey respondent.

Further mining of the data after the contest is possible by contacting Intermedia directly at http://finclusion@intermedia.org and filling out a data request form here
